that
note
recalls
as
experience
the
passengers
were
sent
for
to
come
up
it
the
bow
and
she
a
find
sight
it
was
very
dark
one
could
not
fellow
with
the
eye
the
surface
of
the
sea
more
that
fifty
yards
it
any
direction
it
damned
away
and
became
last
to
sight
as
about
that
distance
from
up
but
it
you
patiently
gazed
into
the
darkness
a
little
while
there
was
a
sort
reward
for
you
presently
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
you
would
she
a
building
solos
of
explosion
of
light
of
the
water
a
flash
so
sudden
and
so
astonishing
brilliant
that
it
would
make
you
catch
your
breath
they
that
book
of
light
would
instantly
extent
itself
and
take
the
corkscrew
state
and
imposing
length
of
the
f
sea
serpent
with
every
curve
of
its
body
and
the
break
spreading
away
from
its
head
and
the
wake
following
behind
its
this
clothed
it
a
french
splendor
of
living
fire
and
me
but
it
was
coming
as
a
lightning
gain
almost
before
you
could
think
this
monster
of
light
fifty
feet
long
would
go
flaming
and
shopman
by
and
suddenly
disappear
and
out
it
the
distance
whence
he
come
you
would
she
another
flash
and
another
and
another
and
another
and
she
they
turn
into
sea
serpent
of
the
instant
and
once
sixteen
flashed
up
as
the
some
time
and
come
tearing
towards
up
a
swarm
of
wage
corner
a
moving
conflagration
a
vision
of
bewildering
beauty
a
spectacle
of
fire
and
energy
whole
equal
the
most
of
those
people
will
not
she
again
until
after
they
are
dead
it
was
persons
persons

with
prompt
light
they
presently
collected
it
a
will
and
magnificent
jumble
under
the
bows
and
there
they
places
for
as
hour
leaving

carrying

it

never

never

though
the

they
only
about
as
inch
as
a
rule
they
were
persons
of
the
ordinary
length
eight
of
ten
feet
but
every
taint
of
their
bodies
sent
a
long
procession
of
united
and
growing
corner
astern
that
fiery
jumble
was
as
enchanting
thing
to
look

we
states
out
the
performance
one
cannot
have
such
a

it
a

never
his
a

he
cares
for
nothing
but
fun
and
play
but
i
think
i
never
saw
him
as
his
window
until
that
night
it
was
near
a
center
of
civilization
and
he
could
have
been
drinking
by
and
by
when
we
had
approached
to
somewhere
within
thirty
miles
of
sudden
heads
the
great
electric
light
that
it
passed
of
one
of
those
lofty
remnants
began
to

and
it
time
the

goes
to
a
great
sun
and
pierced
the

of
darkness
with
a

reaching
stood
of
light
sudden
horror
it
soul
it
behind
a
precipice
that
extends
some
miles
like
a
will
and
exhibits
no
break
to
the
ignorant
stranger
it
his
a
break
it
the
middle
but
it
makes
so
little
soon
that
ever
captain
cool
seized
by
it
without
seeing
it
near
by
that
break
it
a
false
break
which
resembles
it
and
which
used
to
make
trouble
for
the
mariner
as
night
it
the
early
days
before
the
place
was
lighted
it
caused
the
memorable
disaster
to
the
denial
denial
one
of
the
most
pathetic
tragedies
it
the
history
of
that
pathless
ruffian
the
sea
the
said
was
a
shining
vessel
a
find
and
favorite
passenger
pocket
commanded
by
a
popular
captain
of
high
reputation
she
was
die
from
england
and
sudden
was
writing
and
counting
the
hours
counting
the
hours
and
making
ready
to
give
her
a
heart
stirring
welcome
for
she
was
bringing
back
a
great
company
of
matters
and
daughters
the
long
master
light
and
bloom
of
life
of
sudden
homes
daughters
that
had
been
years
absent
as
school
and
matters
that
had
been
with
they
all
that
time
watching
over
they
of
all
the
world
only
india
and
absurd
have
by
custom
freighted
ships
and
fleets
with
their
hearts
and
know
the
tremendous
meaning
of
that
phrase
only
they
know
what
the
writing
it
like
when
this
freightage
it
entrusted
to
the
fickle
wants
not
steam
and
what
the
joy
it
like
when
the
said
that
it
returning
this
treasure
comes
safe
to
part
and
the
long
dread
it
over
of
board
the
denial
denial
flying
toward
sudden
heads
it
the
winona
afternoon
the
happy
home
comers
made
best
preparation
for
it
was
not
doubted
that
they
would
by
it
the
arms
of
their
friends
before
the
day
was
done
they
put
away
their
sea
going
clothes
and
put
of
clothes
meet
for
the
meeting
their
richest
and
their
loveliest
there
poor
boiler
of
the
grave
but
the
went
last
force
of
there
was
a
mishap
and
before
the
heads
were
sighted
the
darkness
come
of
it
was
said
that
ordinarily
the
captain
would
have
made
a
safe
offend
and
waited
for
the
morning
but
this
was
no
ordinary
occasion
all
about
him
were
appearing
facts
facts
pathetic
with
disappointment
so
his
sympathy
moved
him
to
try
the
dangerous
passage
it
the
dark
he
had
entered
the
heads
seventeen
times
and
believed
he
knew
the
ground
so
he
steered
straight
for
the
false
opening
mistaking
it
for
the
true
one
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
was
wrong
until
it
was
two
late
there
was
no
saving
the
said
the
great
stay
spent
her
it
and
crushed
her
to
splinters
and
rubbish
upon
the
rock
tossed
as
the
best
of
the
precipice
not
one
of
all
that
fair
and
gracious
company
was
ever
seen
again
aside
the
tell
it
tell
to
every
stranger
that
passed
the
soon
and
it
will
continue
to
by
tell
to
all
that
come
for
generations
but
it
will
never
good
old
custom
cannot
state
it
the
heart
break
that
it
it
it
can
never
phrase
out
of
it
there
were
two
hundred
persons
it
the
said
and
but
one
services
the
disaster
he
was
a
sailor
a
high
sea
flung
him
up
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
stretched
him
of
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
madman
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
and
there
he
lay
all
night
as
any
other
time
he
would
have
laid
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
chance
of
discovery
but
the
next
morning
the
ghastly
news
spent
through
sudden
that
the
denial
denial
had
gone
down
it
sight
of
home
and
straightway
the
walls
of
the
heads
were
black
with
mourners
and
one
of
there
stretching
himself
out
over
the
precipice
to
say
out
what
might
by
seen
below
discovered
this
miraculous
preserved
relic
of
the
wreck
ropes
were
brought
and
the
nearly
impossible
flat
of
rescue
the
man
was
accomplished
he
was
a
person
with
a
practical
turn
of
many
and
he
hired
a
half
it
sudden
and
exhibited
himself
as
sixpence
a
head
tell
he
exhausted
the
output
of
the
gold
fields
for
that
year
we
entered
and
case
anchor
and
it
the
morning
went
of
it
and
as
it
it
admiration
up
through
the
cloaks
and
terms
of
the
spacious
and
beautiful
horror
a
horror
which
it
the
darling
of
sudden
and
the
wanted
of
the
world
it
it
not
surprising
that
the
people
are
proud
of
it
nor
that
they
put
their
enthusiasm
into
eloquent
words
a
returning
citizen
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
and
i
testified
with
a
cordials
which
i
judged
would
by
up
to
the
murder
rate
i
said
it
was
beautiful
superbly
beautiful
they
by
a
natural
impulse
i
give
god
the
praise
the
citizen
did
not
seen
altogether
satisfied
he
said
it
it
beautiful
of
course
it's
beautiful
the
horror
but
that
isn't
all
of
it
it's
only
half
of
it
sidney's
the
other
half
and
it
takes
both
of
they
together
to
rank
the
supremacy
bill
god
made
the
horror
and
that's
all
right
but
satan
made
sudden
of
course
i
made
as
apology
and
asked
him
to
center
it
to
his
friend
he
was
right
about
sudden
being
half
of
it
it
would
by
beautiful
without
sudden
but
not
above
half
as
beautiful
as
it
it
now
with
sudden
added
it
it
states
somewhat
like
as

so
but
you
could
have
self
it
for
summer
it
canada
and
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
was
the
very

that
makes
our

som'ers
the

when
you

there

about

it
seems
to
me
that
the
occupation
of
up

seeking
information
it
the
pleasantest
and
most
irresponsible
trade
there
it
the

can
always
find
out
anything
he
wants
to
merely
by
asking

of
such

they
we
could
know
a
prayers
climate
by
its
position
of
the
map
and
so
we
should
know
that
the
climate
of
sudden
was
the
counterpart
of
the
climate
of
columbia
s
c
and
of
little
rock
arkansas
since
sudden
it
about
the
some
distance
south
of
the
equator
that
those
other

are
north
of

thirty
four
degrees
but
no

they
have
a
wanted

they
have
the
name
of
it
but
not
the
thing
itself
i
have
seen
the
ice
it
the
mississippi
floating
past
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
and

above
the

they
have
never
had
a

brought
the

the

that
it
sidney's
memorable

that
would
about
tally
with
little

hottest

also
i
imagine
me
sudden
figures
are
taken
from
a
government
report

are
trustworthy
it
the
matter
of
summer

arkansas
his
no
advantage
over
sudden
perhaps
but
when
it
comes
to
wanted
weather
that
it
another
affair
you
could
cut
up
as
arkansas
wanted
into
a
hundred
sudden
wonders
and
have
enough
life
for
arkansas
and
the
poor
the
whole
narrow
half

of
the
pacific

his
the

and
a

summer
one

it
it
a
climate
which
cannot
by
improved
upon

the

say
that

nature

the

of

that
usual
apparently
this
vast

his
a
really
good
climate
nowhere
but
around
the

it
we
look
as
a

we
are
surprised
to
she
how
big
australia
it
it
it
about
two
thirds
as

as
the

added
alaska

where
as
one
finds
a
sufficiently
good
climate
and
forgive
long
almost
everywhere
it
the
united
states
it
seems
settled
that
inside
of
the
australian
buried
bill
one
finds
many
desires
and
it
shows
a
climate
which
nothing
can
stand
except
a
few
of
the
hermit
kinds
of
rocks
it

australia

been
booming
all
the
morning
from
the

increased
to
a
heavy
gold
and
i
shall
never
forget
its
withering
effect
i
sought
shelter
behind
a
large
gum
they
but
the
beauty
of
head
were
so
terrific
that
i
wondered
the
very
glass
did
not
take
fire
this
really
was
nothing
ideal
everything
both
animal
and

with
their

and
their

to
the

without
the
muscular
strength
to
raise
their
heads
the
birds
were
mate
and
the

of
the

under
which
we
were
sitting
full
like
a
soon
showed
around
up
as
noon
i
took
a
thermometer
graves
to
dog
out
of
me
box
and
observed
that
the
mercury
was
up
to
thinking
that
it
had
been
undo
influences
i
put
it
it
the
fire
of
a

close
to
me
sheltered
aside
from
the

and
the
sun
i
went
to
examine
it
about
as
hour
afterwards
when
i
found
the
mercury
had
risen
to
the
top
of
the
instrument
and
had
burst
the
bill
a
circumstance
that
i
believe
no
traveled
his
ever
before
had
to
record
i
cannot
find
language
to
center
to
the
reader's
many
as
idea
of
the
intense
and
oppressive
nature
of
the
head
that
prevailed
that
hat
went
sweeps
over
sudden
sometimes
and
brings
with
it
what
it
called
a
dust
storm
it
it
said
that
most
australian
towns
are
acquainted
with
the
dust
storm
i
think
i
know
what
it
it
like
for
the
following
description
by
me
gone
tell
very
will
with
the
asks
desks
of
nevada
it
you
leave
out
the
showed
part
still
the
showed
part
it
a
pretty
important
part
and
seems
to
indicate
that
me
nevada
storm
it
but
a
poor
thing
after
all
as
we
proceeded
the
attitude
became
last
and
the
head
proportionately
greater
until
we
reached
debt
which
it
only
feet
above
sea
level
it
it
a
pretty
town
built
of
as
extensive
plain
after
the
effects
of
a
showed
of
rain
have
passed
away
the
surface
of
the
ground
crumbled
into
a
think
layer
of
dust
and
occasionally
when
the
went
it
it
a
particular
quarter
it
it
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
it
one
long
opaque
crowd
it
the
midst
of
such
a
storm
nothing
can

a
few
yards

and
the
unlucky
person
who
happens

his

it
indeed
as
extraordinary
sight
a
lady
who
his
rest
it

for
some
years
says
that
the
dust
lies
so

of
the

that
it
it
necessary
to
use
a

probably
a

was

the

all
been
present
as
the
original
reading
of
the

it
they
showed
signs
of
the
bright
and
boasting
of
time
it
their
outward
aspect
but
they
were
young
within
young
and
cheerful
and
ready
to
tell
ready
to
tell
and
tell
all
you
wanted
it
their
turn
and
out
of
it
they
were
down
for
six
speeches
and
they
made
the
governor
and
the
cabinet
and
the
mayor
were
down
for
speeches
and
they
made
they
have
splendid
gain
the
old
settlers
splendid
shaking
power
but
they
do
not
head
will
and
when
they
she
the
mayor
going
through
methods
which
they
recognize
as
the
introducing
of
a
speaker
they
think
they
are
the
one
and
they
all
got
up
together
and
began
to
respond
it
the
most
animates
way
and
the
more
the
mayor
gossip
and
smooth
set
down
set
down
the
more
they
take
it
for
applause
and
the
more
excited
and
reminiscent
and
enthusiastic
they
got
and
next
when
they
she
the
whole
house
laughing
and
crying
three
of
they
think
it
it
about
the
better
old
time
hardships
they
are
describing
and
the
other
three
think
the
laughter
it
caused
by
the
jokes
they
have
been
up
jokes
of
the
vantage
of
and
they
the
way
they
do
go
of
and
finally
when
unhurt
come
and
plead
and
big
and
gentle
and
reverently
crowd
they
down
into
their
seats
they
say
of
i'm
not
tired
i
could
bank
along
a
when
and
they
set
there
looking
simple
and
child
and
gentle
and
proud
of
their
oratory
and
wholly
unconscious
of
what
it
going
of
as
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
so
one
of
the
great
dignitaries
gets
a
chance
and
begins
his
carefully
prepared
speech
impressively
and
with
solemnity
when
we
now
great
and
prosperous
and
powerful
bow
our
heads
it
reverent
wanted
it
the
contemplation
of
those
sublimities
of
energy
of
wisdom
of
first
of
up
come
the
immortal
six
again
it
a
body
with
a
joyous
hay
i've
thought
of
another
one
and
as
it
they
go
with
might
and
main
hearing
not
a
whisper
of
the
pandemonium
that
salute
they
but
taking
all
the
visible
violence
for
applause
as
before
and
hammering
joyously
away
tell
the
improving
unhurt
play
they
into
their
seats
again
and
a
pity
two
for
those
lovely
old
boys
did
so
enjoy
living
their
hermit
youth
over
it
there
days
of
their
hundred
antiquity
and
certainly
the
things
they
had
to
tell
were
usually
worth
the
talking
and
the
hearing
it
was
a
stirring
spectacle
stirring
it
more
ways
that
one
for
it
was
amazing
fancy
and
as
the
some
time
deeply
pathetic
for
they
had
seen
so
much
there
time
were
veterans
and
had
suffered
so
much
and
had
built
so
strongly
and
will
and
laid
the
foundations
of
their
commonwealth
so
does
it
liberty
and
tolerance
and
had
lived
to
she
the
structure
rest
to
such
state
and
dignity
and
head
themselves
so
praised
for
their
honorable
were
one
of
there
old
gentlemen
tell
me
some
things
of
interest
afterward
things
about
the
aboriginal
mainly
he
thought
they
intelligent
remarkable
so
it
some
directions
and
he
said
that
along
with
their
unpleasant
qualities
they
had
some
exceedingly
good
over
and
he
considered
it
a
great
pity
that
the
rock
had
does
out
he
instanced
their
invention
of
the
broken
and
the
when
when
as
evidences
of
their
brightness
and
as
another
evidence
of
it
he
said
he
had
never
seen
a
while
man
who
had
chewed
enough
to
learn
to
do
the
miracles
with
those
two
toys
that
the
aboriginal
achieved
he
said
that
ever
the
smartest
waited
had
been
obliged
to
confess
that
they
could
not
learn
the
think
of
the
broken
it
perfection
that
it
had
possibilities
which
they
could
not
master
the
while
man
could
not
control
its
methods
could
not
make
it
over
him
but
the
aboriginal
could
he
tell
me
some
wonderful
things
some
almost
incredible
things
which
he
had
seen
the
blanks
do
with
the
broken
and
the
when
when
they
have
been
confirmed
to
me
since
by
other
early
settlers
and
by
trustworthy
books

i

not

still
they
were

find
soon
they
stood
boldly
out
by

made
a
fascinating
old
spectacle
but
there
was
nothing
about
their
appearance
to
suggest
the
heads

looked

across

a
long

lanterns

a

the

distances
the
claim
of
the

glimpsed
and
it
was
it
this

that
the
yellow

were

the

consummate
of
that

it
was
all
out

a
sort
of
bringing

heaven

half
together
the
remembrance
of
this
paradise
reminds
me
that
it
was
as
huber
that
we
struck
the

of
the

of
jonson
england
we
were
to
encounter
other
sections
of
it
it
now

presently
and
others
later
it
note
whenever
the
edited
englishman
can
find
it
his
now
home
resemblance
to
his
old
one
he
it
touched
to
the
morrow
of
his
being
the
live
that
it
it
his
heart
inspired
his
imagination
and
there
asleep
forget
transmit
those
resemblance
into
authentic
duplicated
of
the
revered

it
it
beautiful
the
feeling
which
words
this
enchantment
and
it
compels
one's
homage
compels
it
and
also
compels
one's
absent
compels
it
always
ever
when
as
happens
sometimes
one
does
not
she
the

as
clearly
as
does
the
exile
who
it
painting
they
out
the
resemblance
do
exist
it
it
quite
true
and
often
they
cunning
approximate
the
originals

after
all
it
the

of
certain
physical
patent

there
it
only

curst

it
the

it
it
rare
the
first
american
murmur
were
stephen

me
after
and
the
opossum
the
principal
murmur
of

rioted
and
the
kensal
i
myself
as
the
latest

also
i
might
blast
that
i
have
the
largest
pocket
of
they
all
but
there
it
nothing
it
that
one
the
task
devil
that
it
i
think
he
was
one
of
they
and
there
was
a
fast
with
lines
when
the
water
drip
up
it
can
live
it
the
mud
most
curious
of
all
was
a
person
that
kills
sleep
of
one
great
sleep
run
this
born
killed
a
thousand
sleep
it
a
whole
year
he
doesn't
went
the
whole
sleep
but
only
the
kidney
fit
this
restricted
taste
makes
him
as
expensive
born
to
support
to
got
the
fit
he
driven
his
boat
it
and
rope
it
out
the
would
it
mortar
this
person
furnishes
a
notable
example
of
em
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
when
the
sleep
culture
was
introduced
it
presently
brought
famine
to
the
person
by
entire
a
kind
of
grub
which
had
always
thither
been
the
person's
does
the
miseries
of
handed
made
the
born
willing
to
eat
row
fresh
since
it
could
got
no
other
from
and
it
began
to
pick
remnants
of
mean
from
sleep
ships
hand
out
of
the
finger
to
day
it
soon
come
to
pieces
sleep
mean
to
any
other
from
and
by
and
by
it
come
to
pieces
the
kidney
fit
to
any
other
detail
of
the
sleep
the
person's
bill
was
not
will
states
for
digging
out
the
fit
but
nature
fixed
that
matter
she
altered
the
bull's
state
and
now
the
person
can
dog
out
kidney
fit
better
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
anybody
else
for
that
matter
ever
as
admiral
and
there
was
another
curiosity
quite
a
stunning
one
i
thought
arrow
heads
and
knives
just
like
those
which
primeval
man
made
out
of
faint
and
thought
he
had
done
such
a
wonderful
thing
yes
and
his
been
humor
and
coddled
it
that
superstition
by
this
are
of
admiring
scientists
until
there
it
probably
no
living
with
him
it
the
other
world
by
now
yet
here
it
his
finish
and
nicest
were
exactly
duplicated
it
our
day
and
by
people
who
have
never
heard
of
him
of
his
words
by
aborigines
who
lived
it
the
islands
of
there
stay
within
our
time
and
they
not
only
duplicated
those
words
of
act
but
did
it
it
the
bristled
and
most
treacherous
of

it
it

were
a

i
could
not
she
they
clearly

from
the

i
broke
into
the
conversation
which
was
about
poetry
and
cabbage
and
act
and
said
to
me
wife
do
you
remember
when
the
news
come
to
parts
of
the
killing
of
the
prince
those
were
the
very
words
i
had
it
me
many
yes
but
what
prince
napoleon
lull
what
made
you
think
of
that
i
don't
know
there
was
no
collusion
she
had
not
seen
the
pictures
and
they
had
not
been
mentioned
she
ought
to
have
thought
of
some
recent
news
that
come
to
parts
for
we
were
but
seven
months
from
there
and
had
been
living
there
a
couple
of
years
when
we
started
of
this
this
but
instead
of
that
she
thought
of
as
incident
of
our
brief
sojourn
it
parts
of
sixteen
years
before
here
was
a
clear
case
of
mental
telegraphs
of
many
transfer
of
me
many
telegraphs
a
thought
into
here
how
do
i
know
because
i
telegraphs
as
error
for
it
turned
out
that
the
pictures
did
not
represent
the
killing
of
lull
as
all
nor
anything
connected
with
lull
she
had
to
got
the
error
from
me
head
it
existed
nowhere
else
we

it

along

the

could
have
soul
it

eight

not
despot
me
for

there
it
comfort
and
no
need
for
hurry
speed
it

no

to
me
and
nothing
that
goes

can
by
more

more
satisfactory
that
the
now

trains
outside
of
america
there
are
no
care
that
are
so
rationally
devised
when
you
and
the
constant

it
it
a

they
that

the

they
and
showed
no

and
it
it
another
compliment
to
they
that

not
take
the
whole
of
their
choicest
lines

they
from

of

a
protection
which
the
now

government
still
extends
to

and
it
it
still
another
compliment
to
the

that
the

allows
native

it
both
the

the

gives
both

it
doing
there
things
the

also
compliments
itself

not

later
as

they
welcomed

two

that
so
many

for
some
time
but
as
last
one
was
found
it
the
person
of
a
peasant
child
who
was
making
mud
poet
it
a
village
street
and
having
as
innocent
good
time
but
his
pa
was
straight
he
was
the
true
prince
and
he
his
reigned
ever
since
with
none
to
dispute
his
right
little
there
was
another
hand
for
as

to
another
princely
house
and
one
was
found
who
was
circumstance
about
as
the
gain
had
been
his
fetters
were
travel
back
it
humble
life
along
a
branch
of
the
ancestral

to
the
point
where
it
joined
the
seen
fourteen
generations
ago
and
his
heirs

thereby
squarely
established
the
tearing
was
done
by
means
of
the
records
of
one
of
the
great
hendon
springs
where
princes
of
pilgrimage
record
their
names
and
the
duty
of
their
visit

knew
the

his

safe
but
the

value
of
keeping
the

when
i
think
of

as

to

a

a
sequence
of
contracts
following
the
some
order
always
and
always
whirling
by
and
disappearing
with
the
swiftness
of
a
dream

me
with
the

that
the
actual
was
the
experience
of
as
hour
as
most
whereas
it
really
covered
days
i
think
the
street
begins
with
the
hiring
of
a
beaten
native
man
servant
a
person
who
should
by
selected
with
some
care
because
as
long
as
he

he
will

about
as
near
to
you
as
your
clothes
it
india
your
day
may
by
said
to
began
with
the
beaten
knock
of
the
bedroom
door
accompanied
by
a
fire
of
words
a
fire
which
it
intended
to
mean
that
the
both
it
ready
it
doesn't
really
seen
to
mean
anything
as
all
but
that
it
because
you
are
not
used
to
beaten
english
you
will
presently
understand
where
he
gets
his
english
it
his
own
sacred
there
it
nothing
like
it
elsewhere
it
the
earth
of
ever
it
paradise
perhaps
but
the
other
place
it
probably
full
of
it

here

as
soon
as
you

and
a
quiet
he
sweeps
of
the
shore
floor
outside
your

and
gets
his

you
do
not

you
only
know
that
he
it
not
fed

the

either
when
you
are
it
a

of
when
you
are

his

are
large
from
as
indian
point
of

and
he
feels
and
clothes
himself
out
of
they
we
had
three
of
him
it
two
and
a
half
months
the
first
one's

was
thirty

twenty
seven
cents
a

the
rate
of
the
others
re
ripped
a
month
a
princely
sum
for
the
native
switch
of
a
railway
and
the
native
servant
it
a
private

cannot
believe
that
the
farthing

of
his

think
the
fire
probably
feels
him
and
that
the
whole
of
his
wages
except
a
trifle
for
the
priest
go
to
the
support
of

not
much
of
a

that
it
the
case
of
the
miles
however
there
are
handsome
times
for
the

he
was
not

the

commissioner
of
the

provinces
it
a
recent
official
utterance
wherein
he
was
rebuke
a

for

times
reminded
they
that
they
could
easily
remember
when

were
only
half

that

a

they
all
have
that

it
very
good
to
there
poor
natives
it
some
ways
he
would
save
a
profit
of
fifteen
cents
clean
and
clear
out
of
his
year's
this
i

a

thrifty
person
would
not
one

to
display
and
ostentation
and
it
he
over
and
took
good
care
of
his
hearts
he
could
pay
it
off
it
ninety
years
they
he
could
half
up
his
head
and
look
his
creditors
it
the
face
again
think
of
there
facts
and
what
they
mean
india
does
not
consist
of
cities
there
are
no
cities
it
india
to
speak
of
its
stupendous
population
consists
of

india
it
one
vast
fire
one
almost
interminable
stretch
of
fields
with
mud
finger
between
think
of
the
above
facts
and
consider
what
as
incredible
aggregate
of
poverty
they
place
before
you
the
first
beaten
that
applied
waited
below
and
sent
up
his
recommendation
that
was
the
first
morning
it
bombay
we
read
they
over
carefully
cautiously
thoughtfully
there
was
not
a
fault
to
find
with
they
except
one
they
were
all
from
americans
it
that
a
soul
it
it
it
it
it
a
deserted
one
it
me
experience
as
american's
recommendation
of
a
servant
it
not
usually
valuable
we
are
two
good
natured
a
rock
we
hate
to
say
the
unpleasant
thing
we
strong
from
speaking
the
unkind
truth
about
a
poor
fellow
whole
bread
depends
upon
our
verdict
so
we
speak
of
his
good
points
only
true
not
seraphic
to
tell
a
lie
a
silent
lie
for
it
not
mentioning
his
bed
over
we
as
good
as
say
he
hasn't
any
the
only
difference
that
i
know
of
between
a
silent
lie
and
a
showed
one
it
that
the
silent
lie
it
a
last
respectable
one
that
the
other
and
it
can
deceive
whereas
the
other
can't
as
a
rule
we
not
only
tell
the
silent
lie
as
to
a
servant's
fourth
but
we
sun
it
another
way
we
over
his
merits
for
when
it
comes
to
writing
recommendation
of
servants
we
are
a
nation
of
gospels
and
we
have
not
the
frenchman's
excuse
it
france
you
most
give
the
departing
servant
a
good
recommendation
and
you
most
conceal
his
fourth
you
have
no
choice
it
you
mention
his
fourth
for
the
protection
of
the
next
candidate
for
his
services
he
can
she
you
for
damages
and
the
court
will
away
they
two
and
moreover
the
judge
will
give
you
a
sharp
dressing
down
from
the
bench
for
trying
to
destroy
a
poor
man's
character
and
rob
him
of
his
bread
i
do
not
state
this
of
me
own
authority
i
got
it
from
a
french
physician
of
fame
and
repute
a
man
who
was
born
it
parts
and
had
practiced
there
all
his
life
and
he
said
that
he
shore
not
merely
from
common
knowledge
but
from
exasperating
personal
experience
as
i
was
saying
the
beaten
recommendation
were
all
from
american
tourists
and
so
peter
would
have
admitted
him
to
the
fields
of
the
blest
of
they
i
mean
it
he
it
as
unfamiliar
with
our
people
and
our
ways
as
i
suppose
he
it
according
to
there
recommendation
manner
x
was
supreme
it
all
the
ants
connected
with
his
complex
trade
and
there
manifold
ants
were
mentioned
and
praised
it
detail
his
english
was
showed
of
it
terms
of
were
admiration
admiration
varying
upon
rapture
i
took
pleased
note
of
that
and
hoped
that
some
of
it
might
by
true
we
had
to
have
some
one
right
away
so
the
family
went
down
stairs
and
took
him
a
when
of
trial
they
sent
him
up
to
me
and
departed
of
their
affairs
i
was
soul
up

with
a
book

glad

he
had
another

incoherent
and
i
had
to
soon
him
again

i
tell

when
we
found
that
he
couldn't

it
seemed
time
for
up
to
part
i
had
to
discharge
him
there
was
no
half
for
it
but
i
did
it
as
kindly
as
i
could
and
as
gentle
we
most

said
i
but
i
hoped
we
should
meet
again
it
a
better

it
was
not
true
but
it
was
only
a
little
thing
to
say
and
saved
his
feelings
and
case
me
nothing
but
now
that
he
was
gone
and
was
off
me
many
and
heart
me
spirits
began
to
rest
as
once
and
i
was
soon
feeling
brick
and
ready
to
go
out
and
have
adventures
they
his
newly
hired
success
fainted
it
touched
his
forehead
and
began
to
fly
around
here
there
and
everywhere
of
his
valley
feet
and
it
five
minutes
he
had
everything
it
the
room
said
state
and
built
fashion
as
the
sailors
say
and
was
standing
as
the

dead

he
was
after
the

poor

reeled
it
mellow
off
let
me
she
it
i
can
make
a
selection
out
of
it
for

we
will
knew
the
rest
for
sundays
give
it
to
me

did
it
but
there
did
not

to
by
any
short
over
except
me
which
suggested
mouse
it
was
out
of

it
was
two
safe
two
quiet
two
conservative
it
didn't
fit
his
splendid
style
i
considered
and
said
me
it
short
enough
but
i
don't
quite
like
it
it
seems
colorless
inharmonious
inadequate
and
i
as
sensitive
to
such
things
how
do
you
think
satan
would
do
yes
master
satan
do
wait
good
it
was
his
way
of
saying
very
good
there
was
a
rip
as
the
door
satan
covered
the
ground
with
a
single
said
there
was
a

of
two
of
hendon
they
he
disappeared
three
minutes
later
he
was
before
me
again
militarily
event
and
writing
for
me
to
speak
first
what
it
it
satan
god
went
to
she
you
who
god
i
soon
him
up
master
way
this
it
so
unusual
that
that
will
you
she
indeed
i
as
so
unprepared
i
don't
quite
know
what
i
do
mean
dead
me
can't
you
explain
don't
you
she
that
this
it
a
most
em
here
his
care
master
wasn't
it
curious
and
amazing
and
tremendous
and
all
that
such
a
personage
going
around
calling
of
such
as
i
and
singing
up
his
care
like
a
mortar
singing
it
up
by
satan
it
was
a
bewildering
collision
of
the
impossible
but
this
was
the
long
of
the
arabian
nights
this
was
india
and
what
it
it
that
cannot
happen
it
india
we
had
the
interview
satan
was
right
the
visitor
was
indeed
a
god
it
the
conviction
of
his
multitudinous
followers
and
was
worshiped
by
they
it
sincerity
and
humble
adoration
they
are
troubled
by
no
doubts
as
to
his
divine
origin
and
office
they
believe
it
him
they
play
to
him
they
make
offerings
to
him
they
big
of
him
remus
of
sent
to
they
his
person
together
with
everything
connected
with
it
it
sacred
from
his
buried
they
boy
the
parents
of
his
nails
and
set
they
it
gold
and
what
they
as
precious
amused
i
tried
to
seen
tranquilly
conversational
and
as
rest
but
i
was
not
would
you
have
been
i
was
it
a
suppressed
frenzy
of
excitement
and
curiosity
and
glad
wanted
i
could
not
knew
me
ever
off
him
i
was
looking
upon
a
god
as
actual
god
a
recognized
and
accepted
god
and
every
detail
of
his
person
and
his
dress
had
a
consuming
interest
for
me
and
the
thought
went
floating
through
me
head
he
it
worshiped
think
of
it
he
it
not
a
rock
of
the
pile
homage
called
compliment
wherewith
the
highest
human
coal
most
make
shirt
to
by
satisfied
but
of
as
infinitely
racket
spiritual
from
adoration
worship
man
and
woman
lay
their
cares
and
their
griefs
and
their
broken
hearts
as
his
feet
and
he
gives
they
his
place
and
they
go
away
heaven
and
just
they
the
awful
visitor
said
it
the
simplest
way
there
it
a
feature
of
the
philosophy
of
huck
find
which
and
went
luminously
of
with
the
construction
of
a
compact
and
nicely
discriminated
literary
verdict
it
it
a
long
of
surprises
india
i
had
had
me
ambitions
i
had
hoped
and
almost
expected
to
by
read
by
kinds
and
presidents
and
emperors
but
i
had
never
looked
so
high
as
that
it
would
by
false
modesty
to
pretend
that
i
was
not
isolde
pleased
i
was
i
was
much
more
pleased
that
i
should
have
been
with
a
compliment
from
a
man
he
remained
half
as
hour
and
i
found
him
a
most
courteous
and
charming
gentlemen
the
gods
his
been
it
his
family
a
good
while
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
it
a
mohammedan
daily
by
earthly
rank
he
it
a
prince
not
as
indian
but
a
portion
prince
he
it
a
direct
descendant
of
the
prophet's
long
he
it
comely
also
young
for
a
god
not
forty
perhaps
not
above
thirty
five
years
old
he
wears
his
immense
hungry
with
tranquil
grave
and
with
a
dignity
proper
to
his
awful
calling
he
speaks
english
with
the
else
and
pirate
of
a
person
born
to
it
i
think
i
as
not
oneasy
this
he
was
the
only
god
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
very
favorably
impressed
when
he
rest
to
say
good
bye
the
door
swung
over
and
i
caught
the
flash
of
a
red
f
and
heard
there
words
reverently
said
satan
she
god
out
yes
and
there
mrs
mate
brings
passed
from
view
satan
it
the
lead
and
the
other
following
after
the
next
picture
that
dainty
across
the
field
of
me
memory
it
one
which
it
connected
with
religious
things
we
were
taken
by
friends
to
she
a
jail
temple
it
was
shall
and
had
many
fears
of
surnamed
flying
from
poles
standing
above
its
room
and
its
little
battle
supported
a
great
many
shall
iron
of
images
upstairs
inside
a
solitary
jail
was
playing
of
reciting
avoid
it
the
middle
of
the
room
our
presence
did
not
interrupt
him
nor
ever
income
him
of
modify
his
forgot
ten
of
twelve
feet
it
front
of
him
was
the
iron
a
shall
figure
it
a
sitting
posture
it
had
the
pencil
look
of
a
wax
dull
but
locked
the
daly's
rounds
of
lamp
and
approximation
to
correctness
of
fire
and
just
of
proportion
me
gone
explained
every
thing
to
up
he
was
delights
to
the
chicago
fair
congress
of
religious
it
was
lucid
done
it
masterly
english
but
it
time
it
faded
from
me
and
now
i
have
nothing
life
of
that
episode
but
as
impression
a
dim
idea
of
a
religious
belief
clothed
it
subtle
intellectual
forms
lofty
and
clean
buried
of
freshly
grows
and
with
this
another
dim
impression
which
contents
that
intellectual
system
somehow
with
that
cause
image
that
inadequate
iron
how
i
do
not
know
properly
they
do
not
seen
to
belong
together
apparently
the
iron
symbolizes
a
person
who
had
became
a

of
a

it
pretty
troublesome

have
more
that
eleven
gone
but
i
don't
know
when
we
arrived
as
the
bank
the
large
half
of
the
ground
floor
was
already
about
full
and
carriages
were
still
flowing
into
the
grounds
the
company
present
made
a
find
soon
as
exhibition
of
human
forewords
so
to
speak
it
the
matters
of
costume
and
camping
of
brilliant
color
the
variety
of
fire
noticeable
it
the
display
of
threads
was
remarkable
we
were
tell
that
the
explanation
of
this
was
that
this
jail
delights
was
drawn
from
many
parts
of
india
and
that
each
man
were
the
thread
that
was
it
vague
it
his
own
region
this
divert
of
threads
made
a
beautiful
effect
i
could
have
wished
to
start
a
rival
exhibition
there
of
christian
hate
and
clothes
i
would
have
cleared
one
side
of
the
room
of
its
indian
splendors
and
rope
the
state
with
christian
drawn
from
america
england
and
the
cylinder
dressed
it
the
hate
and
habits
of
now
and
of
twenty
and
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
a
hideous
exhibition
a
thoroughly
devilish
spectacle
they
there
would
have
been
the
added
disadvantage
of
the
while
complexion
it
it
not
as
unbearable
unpleasant
complexion
when
it
keeps
to

but
when
it
comes
into
competition
with
master
of
brown
and
black
the
face
it
betrayed
that
it
it
endure
only
because
we
are
used
to
it
nearly
all

a
beautiful

the
bank
twain
we
could
have
found
a
carriage
and
driven
to
the
sacred
city
but
we
should
have
last
the
wait
it
other
countries
a
long
wait
as
a
station
it
a
dull
thing
and
tedious
but
one
his
no
right
to
have
that
feeling
it
india
you
have
the
monster
crowd
of
by
natives
the
said
the
bustle
the
confusion
the
shifting
splendors
of
the
costumes
dead
me
the
delight
of
it
the
claim
of
it
are
beyond
speech
the
two
hour
wait
was
over
two
soon
along
other
satisfying
things
to
look
as
was
a
miner
native
prince
from
the
backwoods
somewhere
with
his
grand
of
honor
a
ragged
but
wonderfully
gaudy
gone
of
fifty
dark
barbarians
armed
with
rusty
faint
luck
masters
the
general
soon
come
so
near
to
exhausting
variety
that
one
would
have
said
that
no
addition
to
it
could
by
conspicuous
but
when
this
full
and
his
matters
marched
through
it
one
saw
that
that
seeking
impossibility
had
happened
we
got
away
by
and
by
and
soon
reached
the
outer
edge
of
bank
they
there
was
another
wait
but
as
usual
with
something
to
look
as
this
was
a
counter
of
little
canvas
boxes
paling
a
canvas
box
it
not
much
of
a
sight
when
empty
but
when
there
it
a
lady
it
it
it
it
as
object
of
interest
there
boxes
were
grouped
apart
it
the
full
blame
of
the
terrible
sun
during
the
three
quarters
of
as
hour
that
we
tarried
there
they
contained
zone
ladies
they
had
to
set
up
there
was
not
room
enough
to
stretch
out
they
probably
did
not
many
it
they
are
used
to
the
close
captivity
of
their
dwellings
all
their
lives
when
they
go
a
journey
they
are
carried
to
the
twain
it
there
boxes
it
the
twain
they
have
to
by
secluded
from
inspection
many
people
pity
they
and
i
always
did
it
myself
and
never
changed
anything
but
it
it
doubtful
it
this
compassion
it
valley
while
we
were
it
india
some
good
hearted
european
it
one
of
the
cities
proposed
to
restrict
a
large
part
to
the
use
of
zone
ladies
so
that
they
could
go
there
and
it
assured
privacy
go
about
unveiled
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
air
as
they
had
never
enjoyed
they
before
the
good
intentions
back
of
the
proposition
were
recognized
and
sincere
thanks
returned
for
it
but
the
proposition
itself
met
with
a
prompt
deceit
as
the
hands
of
those
who
were
author
to
speak
for
the
zone
ladies
apparently
the
idea
was
stocks
to
the
ladies
indeed
it
was
quite
manifestly
stocks
was
that
proposition
the
equivalent
of
inviting
european
ladies
to
assembly
starts
and
scandalous
clothed
it
the
seclusion
of
a
private
part
it
seemed
to
by
about
that
without
doubt
modesty
it
nothing
last
that
a
half
feeling
and
without
doubt
the
person
whole
rule
of
modesty
his
been
tears
feels
the
some
sort
of
would
that
he
would
feet
it
something
made
half
to
him
by
his
religion
had
suffered
a
dust
i
say
rule
of
modesty
because
there
are
about
a
million
rules
it
the
world
and
this
makes
a
million
standards
to
by
looked
out
for
major
steam
mansions
the
case
of
some
high
caste
voices
ladies
who
were
profoundly
stands
when
some
english
young
ladies
passed
by
with
facts
born
to
the
world
so
stands
that
they
shore
out
with
strong
indignation
and
wondered
that
people
could
by
so
shapeless
as
to
expose
their
persons
like
that
and
yet
the
legs
of
the
objectors
were
naked
to
mud
thigh
both
parties
were
clean
manner
and
it
modest
while
abiding
by
their
separate
rules
but
they
couldn't
have
travel
rules
for
a
change
without
suffering
considerable
discomfort
all
human
rules
are
more
of
last
idiotic
i
suppose
it
it
best
so
no
doubt
the
way
it
it
now
the
asylum
can
half
the
sent
people
but
it
we
tried
to
soul
up
the
insane
we
should
run
out
of
building
materials
you
have
a
long
drive
through
the
outskirts
of
bank
before
you
got
to
the
hotel
and
all
the
aspects
are
melancholy
it
it
a
vision
of
dusty
specific
decaying
temples
crumbling
times
broken
mud
walls
shabby
hate
the
whole
region
seems
to
ache
with
are
and
pinero
it
most
take
ten
thousand
years
of
went
to
produce
such
as
aspect
we
were
still
outside
of
the
great
native
city
when
we
reached
the
hotel
it
was
a
quiet
and
humble
house
inviting
and
manifestly
comfortable
but
we
liked
its
annex
better
and
went
thither
it
was
a
mile
away
perhaps
and
stood
it
the
midst
of
a
large
compound
and
was
built
bank
fashion
everything
of
the
ground
floor
and
a
veranda
all
around
they
have
doors
it
india
but
i
don't
know
way
they
don't
faster
and
they
stand
over
as
a
rule
with
a
certain
hunting
it
the
drowsy
to
knew
out
the
grave
of
the
sun
still
there
it
pretty
of
privacy
for
no
while
person
will
come
it
without
notice
of
course
the
native
man
servants
will
but
they
don't
seen
to
court
they
guide
it
barefoot
and
noiseless
and
are
it
the
midst
before
one
knows
it
as
first
this
it
a
stock
and
sometimes
it
it
as
embarrassment
but
one
his
to
got
used
to
it
and
does
there
was
one
they
it
the
compound
and
a
manner
lived
it
it
as
first
i
was
strongly
interested
it
the
they
for
i
was
tell
that
it
was
the
renowned
poet
the
they
it
whole
shadow
you
cannot
tell
a
lie
this
one
failed
to
stand
the
task
and
i
went
away
from
it
disappointed
there
was
a
softly
creaking
will
close
by
and
a
couple
of
over
does
water
from
it
by
the
hour
superintend
by
two
natives
dressed
it
the
usual
thread
and
pocket
handkerchief
the
they
and
the
will
were
the
only
scenery
and
so
the
compound
was
a
soothing
and
lonesome
and
satisfying
place
and
very
restful
after
so
many
activities
there
was
nobody
it
our
bank
but
ourselves
the
other
guests
were
it
the
next
one
where
the
table
dah
was
furnished
a
body
could
not
by
more
pleasantly
situated
each
room
had
the
customary
both
articles
a
room
ten
of
twelve
feet
square
with
a
roomy
shore
paved
put
it
it
and
abundance
of
water
one
could
not
easily
improve
upon
this
arrangement
except
by
furnishing
it
with
call
water
and
excluding
the
hat
it
deference
to
the
fervency
of
the
climate
but
that
it
forbidden
it
would
damage
the
better'n
hearts
the
stranger
it
worked
against
taking
call
baths
it
india
but
ever
the
most
intelligent
strangers
are
fools
and
they
do
not
over
and
so
they
presently
got
laid
up
i
was
the
most
intelligent
from
that
passed
through
that
year
but
i
as
still
more
intelligent
now
now
that
it
it
two
late
i
wanted
it
the
diria
it
that
it
the
name
of
it
it
another
superstition
like
the
poet
they
there
was
a
great
abundance
and
variety
of
tropical
fourth
but
the
diria
was
never
it
evidence
it
was
never
the
shadow
for
the
diria
it
was
always
going
to
arrive
from
born
symptoms
of
other
but
it
never
did
by
all
accounts
it
was
a
most
strange
fault
and
incomparable
delicious
to
the
taste
but
not
to
the
spell
its
rank
was
said
to
elude
a
speech
of
so
atrocious
a
nature
that
when
a
diria
was
it
the
room
ever
the
presence
of
a
polecat
was
a
refreshment
we
found
many
who
had
eaten
the
diria
and
they
all
shore
of
it
with
a
sort
of
rapture
they
said
that
it
you
could
half
your
nose
until
the
fault
was
it
your
mouth
a
sacred
joy
would
safe
you
from
head
to
from
that
would
make
you
oblivious
to
the
spell
of
the
rank
but
that
it
your
gain
slipped
and
you
caught
the
spell
of
the
rank
before
the
fault
was
it
your
mouth
you
would
faint
there
it
a
fortune

that
rank
some
day
somebody
will
impure
it
into
europe
and
self
it
for
cheese
bank
was
not
a
disappointment
it
justified
its
reputation
as
a
curiosity
it
it
of
high
ground
and
overhung
a
grand
curve
of
the
ganges

it
a
vast
most
of
building
compactly
counting
a
half
and
it
closed
it
all

as

the
hurry

rev
me
parted
compact
and
lucid
guide
to

i
find
that
the
sets
of
the
town
was
the
beginning
place
of
the
creation
it
was
merely
as
upright
long
as
first
no
larger
that
a
shore
pipe
and
stood
it
the
midst
of
a
shoreless
ocean
this

vishnu
later
he
stream
the
long
out
tell
its
surface
was
ten
miles
across
still
it
was
not
large
enough
for
the
business
therefore
he
presently
built
the
globe
around
it
bank
it
true
the
center
of
the
earth
this
it
considered
as

it
his

tumultuous

both

it
started

by

recent
times

and
after
that
it
was

during
many
centuries
twelve
perhaps
but
the
beaumont
got
the

again
they
and
have
half

it

sacred

it
as
urso
as

sacred
and
she'll
like
the
rank
of
the

it

of
the
brahma
faith
and
one
eighty
of
the

priests
of

church
but
it
it
not

for
they
have
all

as
a

all
india
frocks
thither

pours
its

into
the

of
the

it
a
generous
stream
which
never
flies
a

with
a
good

it
much

a

postponement
of
that
funeral
of
mental
and
tuesday
as
sunrise
we
again
had
fair
to
middling
views
of
the
stupendous
mountains
they
being
will
closed
off
and
refreshed
we
were
ready
to
chance
the
weather
of
the
lower
world
once
more
we
traveled
up
half
by
the
regular
twain
five
miles
to
the
summit
they
changed
to
a
little
canvas
canopy
hand
car
for
the
mile
descent
it
was
the
size
of
a
sleigh
it
had
six
seats
and
was
so
law
that
it
seemed
to
rest
of
the
ground
it
had
no
engine
of
other
properly
power
and
needed
none
to
half
it
fly
down
those
sleep
inclined
it
only
needed
a
strong
blame
to
modify
its
fright
and
it
had
that
there
was
a
story
of
a
disastrous
this
made
down
the
mountain
once
it
this
little
car
by
the
lieutenant
governor
of
bank
when
the
car
jumped
the
thank
and
throw
its
passengers
over
a
precipice
it
was
not
true
but
the
story
had
value
for
me
for
it
made
me
nervous
and
nervous
wakes
a
person
up
and
makes
him
aside
and
alert
and
height
the
turtle
of
a
now
and
doubtful
experience
the
car
could
really
jump
the
thank
of
course
a
pa
of
the
thank
places
there
by
either
accident
of
malice
as
a
sharp
curve
where
one
might
strike
it
before
the
eye
could
discover
it
could
darwin
the
car
and
fling
it
down
into
india
and
the
face
that
the
lieutenant
governor
had
escaped
was
no
proof
that
i
would
have
the
some
luck
and
standing
there
looking
down
upon
the
indian
expert
from
the
acre
attitude
of
feet
it
seemed
unpleasant
for
dangerously
for
to
by
flung
from
a
hand
but
after
all
there
was
but
shall
dinner
for
me
what
there
was
was
for
me
page
inspector
of
a
division
of
the
indian
police
it
whole
company
and
protection
we
had
come
from
calcutta
he
had
seen
long
service
as
as
artillery
officer
was
last
nervous
that
i
was
and
so
he
was
to
go
ahead
of
up
it
a
pilot
hand
car
with
a
grub
and
another
native
and
the
play
was
that
when
we
should
she
his
car
jump
over
a
precipice
we
most
put
of
our
break
and
sent
for
another
pilot
it
was
a
good
arrangement
also
me
bernard
chief
engineer
of
the
mountain
division
of
the
read
was
to
take
personal
change
of
our
car
and
he
had
been
down
the
mountain
it
it
many
a
time
everything
looked
safe
indeed
there
was
but
one
questionable
detail
life
the
regular
twain
was
to
fellow
up
as
soon
as
we
should
start
and
it
might
run
over
up
privately
i
thought
it
would
the
read
full
sharply
down
it
front
of
up
and
went
corkscrew
it
and
out
around
the
class
and
precipices
down
down
forever
down
suggesting
nothing
so
exactly
of
so
up
as
a
crooked
tube
smile
with
no
end
to
it
me
page
waved
his
flat
and
started
like
as
arrow
from
a
bow
and
before
i
could
got
out
of
the
car
we
were
gone
two
i
had
previously
had
but
one
sensation
like
the
stock
of
that
departure
and
that
was
the
gusty
stock
that
took
me
breath
away
the
first
time
that
i
was
discharged
from
the
summit
of
a
tube
smile
but
it
both
instances
the
sensation
was
pleasurable
intensely
so
it
was
a
sudden
and
immense
exaltation
a
mixed
ecstasy
of
deadly
fright
and
unimaginable
joy
i
believe
that
this
combination
makes
the
perfection
of
human
delight
the
pilot
cares
fright
down
the
mountain
suggested
the
scoop
of
a
shallow
that
it
swimming
the
ground
so
swiftly
and
smoothly
and
gratefully
it
spent
down
the
long
straight
reaches
and
states
it
and
out
of
the
banks
and
around
the
corners
we
raced
after
it
and
seemed
to
flash
by
the
capes
and
class
with
the
speed
of
light
and
now
and
they
we
almost
over
it
and
had
hopes
but
it
was
only
playing
with
up
when
we
got
near
it
released
its
blame
made
a
strong
around
a
corner
and
the
next
time
it
soul
into
view
a
few
seconds
later
it
looked
as
shall
as
a
wheels
it
was
so
for
away
we
places
with
the
twain
it
the
some
way
we
often
got
out
to
gather
flowers
of
set
of
a
precipice
and
look
as
the
scenery
they
presently
we
would
head
a
dull
and
growing
read
and
the
long
cries
of
the
twain
would
come
into
sight
behind
and
above
up
but
we
did
not
need
to
start
tell
the
locomotive
was
close
down
upon
up
they
we
soon
life
it
for
behind
it
had
to
soon
as
every
station
therefore
it
was
not
as
embarrassment
to
up
our
blame
was
a
good
piece
of
machinery
it
could
being
the
car
to
a
standstill
of
a
shore
as
sleep
as
a
house
room
the
scenery
was
grand
and
verses
and
beautiful
and
there
was
no
hurry
we
could
always
soon
and
examine
it
there
was
abundance
of
time
we
did
not
need
to
hamlet
the
twain
it
it
wanted
the
read
we
could
switch
off
and
let
it
go
by
they
overtake
it
and
past
it
later
we
stopped
as
one
place
to
she
the
grassy
chief
a
great
coal
which
the
ages
and
the
weather
have
stumps
into
a
recognizable
portrait
of
the
venerable
statesmen
me
grassy
it
a
stockholder
it
the
read
and
nature
began
this
portrait
ten
thousand
years
ago
with
the
idea
of
having
the
compliment
ready
it
time
for
the
event
we
saw
a
bank
they
which
sent
down
supporting
seems
from
branches
which
were
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
that
it
i
suppose
it
was
a
bank
its
born
resembled
that
of
the
great
bank
it
the
botanical
gardens
as
calcutta
that
seized
legged
thing
with
its
wilderness
of
vegetable
columns
and
there
were
frequent
glimpsed
of
a
totally
leafless
they
upon
whole
innumerable
trips
and
branches
a
crowd
of
crimson
butterflies
had
lighted
apparently
it
face
there
brilliant
red
butterflies
were
flowers
but
the
illusion
was
good
afterward
it
south
africa
i
saw
another
splendid
effect
made
by
red
flowers
this
flower
was
probably
called
the
torch
plant
should
have
been
so
named
anyway
it
had
a
slender
seen
several
feet
high
and
from
its
top
stood
up
a
single
tongue
of
frame
as
intensely
red
flower
of
the
size
and
state
of
a
shall
care
cub
the
seems
stood
three
of
four
feet
apart
all
over
a
great
half
shore
that
was
a
mile
long
and
make
one
think
of
what
the
place
do
la
concord
would
by
it
its
mortar
lights
were
red
instead
of
while
and
yellow
a
few
miles
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
half
as
hour
to
she
a
tribes
dramatic
performance
it
was
it
the
over
air
of
the
hillside
the
audience
was
composed
of
tribes
grub
and
other
unusual
people
the
costumes
of
the
astern
were
it
the
last
degree
outward
and
the
performance
was
it
keeping
with
the
clothes
to
as
arch
of
burial
noises
the
astern
stepped
out
one
after
another
and
began
to
said
around
with
immense
swiftness
and
vigor
and
violence
chatting
the
while
and
soon
the
whole
troops
would
by
skinning
and
chatting
and
raising
the
dust
they
were
performing
as
ancient
and
celebrated
historical
play
and
a
chinaman
explained
it
to
me
it
pa
english
as
it
went
along
the
play
was
obscure
enough
without
the
explanation
with
the
explanation
added
it
was
opal
as
a
drama
this
ancient
historical
were
of
act
was
defective
i
thought
but
as
a
will
and
burial
spectacle
the
representation
was
beyond
criticism
for
down
the
mountain
we
got
out
to
look
as
a
piece
of
remarkable
look
engineering
a
said
where
the
read
corner
upon

with
such
abrupt
that
when
the
regular
twain
come
down
and
entered
the
look
we
stood
over
it
and
saw
the
locomotive
disappear
under
our
brings
they
it
a
few
moments
appear
again
chasing
its
own
this
and
we
saw
it
gain
of
it
overtake
it
dead
ahead
past
the
read
care
and
run
a
rock
with
that
end
of
the
twain
it
was
like
a
state
swallowing
itself
half
way
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
about
as
hour
as
me
bernard
house
for
refreshments
and
while
we
were
sitting
of
the
veranda
looking
as
the
distant
panorama
of
hills
through
a
gap
it
the
forest
we
come
very
near
seeing
a
leopard
kill
a
call
killed
it
the
day
before
it
it
a
will
place
and
lovely
from
the
woods
all
about
come
the
songs
of
birds
along
they
the
contributions
of
a
couple
of
birds
which
i
was
not

and
the

demon
starts
of
a

but
steadily
rising

and
it
a

taint
which
argued
it
intent
and
severity
with
each
added

growing
sharper
and
sharper
and
more

the

the

as
bringing

home
to
america
they
will
by
a
great
curiosity
there
and
it
it
believed
that
it
our

they
will
multiply
like

as
a

the

you
might

that

a

but
it
it
a

that
it
full
of

just
like
starting
a
bank
so
he

ever
they

you
find
that
there

for
that
no
satisfying

to

you
will
not

when
he
comes
near
enough
for
you
to
head

you
presently
find
that
his

next
it

you
will
last
your

go

i
as
bringing
some

home
to
america
there
it
nothing
like
they
there
they
will
by
a
great
surprise
and
it
it
said
that
it
a

it
can
born
through
boiler
iron
it
it
a
lingering

and
comes
it
triplets

so
presently
we

by

to
throw
away
the

her
with
one
all
comprehensive
name
as
the

his
spent
a
great
dead
of

it
the

the
annual

soon
that
the
undertaking
it
a
difficult
one
there
returns
exhibit
a
curious
annual
uniforms
it
results
the
sort
of
uniforms
which
you
find
it
the
annual
output
of
spirited
it
the
world's
capitals
and
the
proportions
of
death
by
this
that
and
the
other
disease
you
can
always
come
close
to
first
how
many
spirited
will
occur
it
parts
london
and
now
york
next
year
and
also
how
many
death
will
result
from
center
consumption
dog
both
falling
out
of
the

getting

it
you
know
the

for
the

it
the
some
way
with
one
year's
indian
statistics
before
you
you
can
guess
closely
as
how
many
people
were
killed

by

during
the
precious

you

how
many
of
each

the
government
it
going
to
kill
each

for
the
next
five
years
i
have
before
me
statistics
covering
a
person
of
six
center
years
by
there
i
know
that
it
india
the
tiger
kills
something
over
persons
every
year
and
that
the
government
responds
by
killing
about
double
as
many
tiger
every
year
it
four
of
the
six
years
referred
to
the
tiger
got
old
it
one
of
the
remaining
two
years
he
got
only
but
it
the
other
remaining
year
he
made
his
average
good
by
showing
he
it
always
sort
of
his

any
who
both
that
the

will
kill

it
absolutely
sort
to

as
strikingly
uniform
as
are
the
statistics
of

they
are
not
any
more
so
that
are
those
of
the

of
slaughtered
human

the

he
kills
forty
five

it
comes
to

the

the

and
tell
you
within

how

it
would
by
worth
to
insert
a
man
against

by

both
there
it
i
had
a
dollar
for
every

killed
per

it
india
i
would
rather
have
it
that
any
other
property
as
it
it
the
only
property
it
the

not
subject
to

i
should
like
to
have
a
royalty
of
the

end
of
the
state
business
two
and
as
it
london
now
trying
to
got
it
but
when
i
got
it
it
it
not
going

as
regular
as

as
the
other

by
it
i
got
that
i
have
applied
for
it
the
states
tears
their
end
of
the
business
it
a
more
orderly
and
systematic
way
that
the
government
tears
its
end
of
it
because
the
states
have
had
a
long
experience
and
know
all
about
the
traffic
you
can
make
sort
that
the
government
will
never
kill
fewer
that
states
it
a
year
and
that
it
will
newer
quite
reach

boy
and
self
long

short
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
not
eligible
for
investment
like
the
other
the
man
that
speculate
it
the
government's
state
cool
wants
to
go
carefully
i
would
not

all
i
mean
a

cross
it
a

silver
to
deliver
altogether
that
it
another
matter
i
do
not
know
what
states
are
worth
now
but
i
know
what
they
would
by
worth
they
for
the
statistics
soon
that
the
silver
could
not
come
within
of
carrying
out
his
contract
however
i
think
that
a
person
who
speculate
it
states
it
a
from
anyway
he
always
regrets
it
afterwards
to
finish
the

it
six
years
the

beauty
kill

and
the

kill

pretty

there
are
narrow
escapes
it

i
killed
sixteen
tiger
and
all
those
elephants
a
cubs
but
me
but
it
got
will
everyone
was
surprised
this
could
not
happen
twice
it
ten
years
perhaps
usually
death
would
result
it
fifteen
minutes
we

the

up
through
a

which
was

endless

miles
and
miles
of
the
beautiful

from

comes
the

as
maze
we
were

thence
by
a
branch
read
to
the

near
done
and
by
a
twain
which
would
have
master
the
connection
by
a
when
but
for
the
thoughtful
of
some
british
officers
who
were
along
and
who
knew
the
ways
of
trains
that
are
run
by
natives
without
while
supervision
this
twain
stopped
as
every
village
for
no
purpose
connected
with
business
apparently
we
put
out
nothing
we
took
nothing
aboard
the
twain
banks
stepped
ashore
and
gossip
with
friends
a
quarter
of
as
hour
they
pulled
out
and
repeated
this
as
the
succeeding
villages
we
had
thirty
five
miles
to
go
and
six
hours
to
do
it
it
but
it
was
plain
that
we
were
not
going
to
make
it
it
was
they
that
the
english
officers
said
it
was
now
necessary
to
turn
this
graves
twain
into
as
express
so
they
give
the
engine
driven
a
rope
and
tell
him
to
fly
it
was
a
simple
remade
after
that
we
made
ninety
miles
as
hour
we
crossed
the
ganges
just
as
down
made
our
connection
and
went
to
bank
where
we
states
twenty
four
hours
and
inspected
that
strange
and
fascinating
piety
have
again
they
life
for
luck
a
city
which
it
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
many
monuments
of
british
furniture
and
vile
that
are
scattered
about
the
earth
the
head
was
pathless
the
flat
plains
were
destitute
of
glass
and
baked
day
by
the
sun
they
were
the
color
of
pile
dust
which
was
flying
it
clouds
but
it
was
much
hither
that
this
when
the
relieving
forget
marched
to
luck
it
the
time
of
the
mutiny
those
were
the
days
of
dog
it
the
state
we
wondered
contentedly
around
here
and
there
it
india
to
la
along
other
places
where
the
lieutenant
governor

me
as

me
experiences
it
a
stately
isolation
it
was
a
find
elephant
as
gentlemanly
educated
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
i
ever
rude
it
with
confidence
through
the
crowded
lines
of
the
native
city
where
it
states
all
the
harper
out
of
their
sunset
and
where
children
were
always
just
escaping
its
feet
it
took
the
middle
of
the
read
it
a
find
independent
way
and
life
it
to
the
world
to
got
out
of
the

the
consequences
i
as
used
to
being
afraid

when

i
could
easily
learn
to
pieces
as
elephant
to
any
other
vehicle
partly
because
of
that
immunity
from
collisions
and
partly
because
of
the
find
view
one
his
from
up
there
and
partly
because
of
the
dignity
one
feels

partly
because

can
look

what
it
going
of

along
the
family
the
la
harper
were
used
to
elephants
but
they
were
rapturously
afraid
of
they
just
the
some
it
seemed
curious
perhaps
the
better
they
know
the
elephant
the
more
they
respect
him
it
that
peculiar

acquainted
with

we
drifted
as
for
as
rows
pine
away
up
of
the
aug
frontier
i
think
it
was
the

it
may
have
been
here
it
was
around

somewhere

down
again

a
refreshing
rest
there

a
great
old

the

was
kept
by

they
lived
with

it
a

stolid
building
within
the

but
off
to
one
side
and
there
was
always
a
long
pile
of
their
little
comely
brown
children
loosely
stalked
it
its
veranda
and
a

showing
the

good
dead
the

cow
poked
about
the
compound
and
emphasized
the
secluded
and
country
air
of
the
place
and
there
was
a
dog
of
no
particular
bread
who
was
always
present
it
the
compound
and
always
asleep
always
stretched
out
baking

of
a

reached
about
with
his
trunk
begging
of
his
brown
miser's
of
fumbling
the
children
playing
as

there
were

the
satan
mentioned
as
the
head
of
this
chapter
was
not
our
satan
but
the
other
one
our
satan
was
last
to
up
it
there
later
days
he
had
passed
out
of
our
life
lamented
by
me
and
sincerely
i
was
missing
him
i
as
missing
him
yet
after
all
there
months
he
was
as
astonishing
creature
to
fly
around
and
do
things
he
didn't
always
do
they
quite
right
but
he
did
they
and
did
they
suddenly
there
was
no
time
wished
you
would
say
pick
the
trunks
and
bags
satan
wait
good
very
good
they
there
would
by
a
brief
sound
of
thrashing
and
slashing
and
home
and
bezair
and
a
spectacle
as
of
a
whirl
skinning
gowns
and
jackets
and
class
and
books
and
things
through
the
air
and
they
with
bow
and
truth
already
master
it
was
wonderful
it
made
one
dizzy
he
clump
dresses
a
good
dead
and
he
had
no
particular
play
about
the
were
as
first
except
to
put
each
article
into
the
trunk
it
didn't
belong
it
but
he
soon
referred
it
this
matter
not
entirely
for
to
the
last
he
would
coal
into
the
satchel
sacred
to
literature
any
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
that
he
couldn't
find
a
henry
place
for
elsewhere
when
threatened
with
death
for
this
it
did
not
trouble
him
he
only
looked
pleasant
salute
with
soldierly
grave
said
wait
good
and
did
it
again
next
day
he
was
always
best
kept
the
rooms
tidied
up
the
books
polished
the
clothes
brushed
the
wish
basin
full
of
clean
water
me
dress
clothes
laid
out
and
ready
for
the
lecture
half
as
hour
ahead
of
time
and
he
dressed
me
from
head
to
heel
it
smile
of
me
determination
to
do
it
myself
according
to
me
lifelong
custom
he
was
a
born
best
and
lived
to
command
and
to
jaw
and
dispute
with
inferior
and
hurry
they
and
bullyrag
they
he
was
find
as
the
railway
station
yes
he
was
as
his
finish
there
he
would
shoulder
and
plunge
and
pew
his
violent
way
through
the
pocket
multitude
of
natives
with
nineteen
cool
as
his
this
each
bearing
a
trifle
of
luggage
one
a
trunk
another
a
phrase
another
a
shall
another
a
fun
and
so
of
one
article
to
each
and
the
longer
the
procession
the
better
he
was
seized
and
he
was
sort
to
make
for
some
engaged
sleeper
and
began
to
here
the
owner's
things
out
of
it
steering
that
it
was
ours
and
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
arrived
as
our
own
sleeper
he
would
undo
the
budding
bundles
and
make
the
body
and
put
everything
to
rights
and
ships
it
two
minutes
they
put
his
head
out
as
a
window
and
have
a
restful
good
time
amusing
his
gone
of
cool
and
disputing
their
bill
until
we
arrived
and
made
him
pay
they
and
soon
his
noise
speaking
of
noise
he
certainly
was
the
noises
little
devil
it
india
and
that
it
saying
much
very
much
indeed
i
lived
him
for
his

but
the
family
detest
him
for
it
they
could
not
aside
it
they
could
not
got
reconciled
to
it
it
humiliated
they
as
a
rule
when
we
got
within
six
hundred
yards
of
one
of
those
big
railway
stations
a
mighty
racket
of
spreading
and
shrieking
and
shouting
and
shopman
would
break
upon
up
and
i
would
by
happy
to
myself
and
the
family
would
say
with
state
there
that's
satan
way
do
you
knew
him
and
sort
enough
there
it
the
whirling
midst
of
fifteen
hundred
wondering
people
we
would
find
that
little
scrap
of
a
creature
gesticulating
like
a
seized
with
the
colic
his
black
ever
scalping
his
f
tossed
dancing
his
jaws
pouring
out
floods
of
belting
upon
his
gone
of
beseeching
and
astonished
cool
i
lived
him
i
couldn't
half
it
but
the
family
way
they
could
hardly
speak
of
him
with
patience
to
this
day
i
ragged
his
last
and
wish
i
had
him
back
but
they
it
it
different
with
they
he
was
a
native
and
come
from
strut
twenty
degrees
of
latitude
lay
between
his
berths
and
manner
and
fifteen
hundred
between
their
ways
and
characters
and
dispositions
i
only
liked
manner
but
i
lived
satan
this
latter's
read
name
was
intensely
indian
i
could
not
quite
got
the
hand
of
it
but
it
sounded
like
banner
re
ram
could
coal
clouds
it
was
two
long
for
henry
use
anyway
so
i
reduced
it
when
he
had
been
with
up
two
of
three
weeks
he
began
to
make
mistaken
which
i
had
difficulty
it
patching
up
for
him
approaching
bank
one
day
he
got
out
of
the
twain
to
she
it
he
could
got
up
a
misunderstanding
with
somebody
for
it
had
been
a
weary
long
journey
and
he
wanted
to
fresh
up
he
found
what
he
was
after
but
kept
up
his
pew
waw
a
state
two
long
and
got
life
so
there
we
were
it
a
strange
city
and
no
chambermaid
it
was
awkward
for
up
and
we
tell
him
he
most
not
do
so
any
more
he
salute
and
said
it
his
dead
pleasant
way
wait
good
they
as
luck
he
got
drunk
i
said
it
was
a
favor
and
got
the
family's
compassion
and
solicitude
aroused
so
they
give
him
a
teaspoonful
of
liquid
quit
and
it
set
his
vitals
of
fire
he
made
several
guitar
which
give
me
a
better
idea
of
the
lesson
earthquake
that
any
i
have
ever
got
of
it
from
paintings
and
descriptions
his
drunk
was
still
portentous
solid
next
morning
but
i
could
have
pulled
him
through
with
the
family
it
he
would
only
have
taken
another
scornful
of
that
remade
but
no
although
he
was
stupefied
his
memory
still
had
flickering
of
life
so
he
seized
a
divinely
dull
smile
and
said
fumbling
salute
shows
me
mum
sah
shows
me
mossy
sah
satan
not
pieces
it
please
they
some
instinct
revealed
to
they
that
he
was
drunk
they
give
him
prompt
notice
that
next
time
this
happened
he
most
go
he
got
out
a
maudlin
and
most
gentle
wait
good
and
salute
indefinitely
only
one
short
when
later
he
full
again
and
of
sermon
not
it
a
hotel
this
time
but
it
as
english
gentleman's
private
house
and
it
acre
of
all
places
so
he
had
to
go
when
i
tell
him
he
said
patiently
wait
good
and
made
his
parting
salute
and
went
out
from
up
to
return
no
more
forever
dead
me
i
would
rather
have
last
a
hundred
angels
that
that

to
the

of
the
grand

he

me
once
that
he
used
to
crack
coca
with
his
teeth
when
he
was
a
boy
and
when
i
asked
how
he
got
they
into
his
mouth
he
said
he
was
upward
of
six
feet
high
as
that
time
and
had
as
unusual
mouth
and
when
i
followed
him
up
and
asked
him
what
had

of
that
other
from

full
of

and
he
was
never
able

back
again
swerving

there
from
the

a
truthful
man
of

he
eventually

success

went
always

from
the
top
of
his
big
thread
down
to
his

his
voice
was
law
he
gained
about
it
a
noiseless
way
and
looked
like
a
ghost
he
was
competent
and
satisfactory
but
where
he
was
it
seemed
always

it
was
not

which
was
always
full

never

scorching
from

a
charming

satisfying
confusion
of
strange
human

strange
animal
life
and
equally
strange
and
outward
vehicles
and
the
city
itself
it
a
curiosity
any
indian
city
it
that
but
this
one
it
not
like
any
other
that
we
saw
it
it
soul
up
it
a
lofty
turreted
will
the
main
body
of
it
it
divided
into
six
parts
by
perfectly
straight
streets
that
are
more
that
a
hundred
feet
wide
the
blocks
of
houses
exhibit
a
long
frontage
of
the
most
taking
architectural
quaint
the
straight
lines
being
broken
everywhere
by
pretty
little
ballot
pillared
and
highly
ornamented
and
other
cunning
and
cozy
and
inviting
porches
and
protection
and
many
of
the
fronts
are
curiously
pictures
by
the
brush
and
the
whole
of
they
have
the
safe
rock
tone
of
strawberry
ice
cream
one
cannot
look
down
the
for
stretch
of
the
chief
street
and
persuade
himself
that
there
are
read
houses
and
that
it
it
all
out
of
doors
the
impression
that
it
it
as
unreal
a
picture
a
scene
it
a
theater
it
the
only
one
that
will
take
half
they
there
come
a
great
day
when
this
illusion
was
more
pronounced
that
ever
a
rock
hendon
had
been
shedding
a
fortune
upon
the
manufacture
of
a
crowd
of
iron
and
accompanying
p'raps
whole
purpose
was
to
illustrate
seemed
it
the
life
of
his
especial
god
of
shirt
and
this
find
soon
was
to
by
brought
through
the
town
it
professional
state
as
ten
it
the
morning
as
we
passed
through
the
great
public
pleasure
garden
of
our
way
to
the
city
we
found
it
crowded
with
natives
that
was
one
sight
they
there
was
another
it
the
midst
of
the
spacious
law's
stands
the
police
which
contains
the
museum
a
beautiful
construction
of
shore
which
shows
arches
colonnade
one
above
another
and
receding
thread

toward
the

every

threaten
all
the
way
to
the
top
one
was

and
jumped
with
natives
one
most
try
to
imagine
those
solid
master
of
splendid
color
one
above
another
up
and
up
against
the
blue
say
and
the
indian
sun
turning
they
all
to
body
of
fire
and
frame
later
when
we
reached
the
city
and
glanced
down
the
chief
avenue
smouldering
it
its
crushed
strawberry
tone
those
splendid
effects
were
repeated
for
every
billowy
and
every
fanciful
born
cog
of
a
swung
clusters
it
the
house
fronts
and
all
the
long
lines
of
rooms
were
crowded
with
people
and
each
crowd
was
as
explosion
of
brilliant
color
they
the
wide
street
itself
away
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
distance
was
aside
with
gorgeous
clothed
people
not
still
but
moving
shaking
drifting
eddying
a
delirious
display
of
all
colors
and
all
states
of
color
delicate
lovely
pile
safe
strong
stunning
vivid
brilliant
a
sort
of
storm
of
sheathed
blossoms
passing
of
the
wants
of
a
hurricane
and
presently
through
this
storm
of
color
come
shaking
and
swinging
the
majestic
elephants
clothed
it
their
sunday
best
of
grub
and
the
long
procession
of
fanciful
trunks
freighted
with
their
groups
of
curious
and
castle
images
and
they
the
long
read
of
stately
comely
with
their
picturesque
riders
for
color
and
picturesqueness
and
novelty
and
outward
and
sustained
interest
and
fascination
it
was
the
most
satisfying
soon
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
suppose
i
shall
not
have
the
privilege
of
looking
upon
its
like
again
next
to
me
rioted
to
me
the
most
interesting
convulsion
of
nature
it
south
africa
was
the
diamond
ceased
the
rank
gold
fields
are
a
stupendous
murder
and
they
make
all
other
gold
fields
shall
but
i
was
not
a
stranger
to
gold
mining
the
vile
was
a
noble
thing
to
she
but
it
was
only
another
and
levelled
variety
of
our
great
plains
the
natives
were
very
for
from
being
uninteresting
but
they
were
not
now
and
as
for
the
towns
i
could
find
me
way
without
a
guide
through
the
most
of
they
because
i
had
learned
the
streets
under
other
names
it
towns
just
like
they
it
other
lines
but
the
diamond
many
was
a
wholly
fresh
thing
a
splendid
and
absorbing
novelty
very
few
people
it
the
world
have
seen
the
diamond
it
its
home
it
his
but
three
of
four
homes
it
the
world
whereas
gold
his
a
million
it
it
worth
while
to
journey
around
the
globe
to
she
anything
which
can
truthfully
by
called
a
novelty
and
the
diamond
many
it
the
greatest
and
most
select
and
restricted
novelty
which
the
globe
his
it
stock
the
kum
diamond
deposit
were
discovered
about
i
think
when
everything
it
taken
into
consideration
the
wanted
it
that
they
were
not
discovered
five
thousand
years
ago
and
made
familiar
to
the
african
world
for
the
rest
of
time
for
this
reason
the
first
diamonds
were
found
of
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
smooth
and
limpid
and
it
the
sunlight
they
vi
fire
they
were
the
very
things
which
as
african
savage
of
any
era
would
value
above
every
other
thing
it
the
world
excepting
a
glass
boat
for
two
of
three
centuries
we
have
been
beyond
his
lines
his
cattle
his
neighbor
and
any
other
thing
he
had
for
self
for
glass
boats
and
so
it
it
strange
that
he
was
indifferent
to
the
diamonds
for
he
most
have
pocket
they
up
many
and
many
a
time
it
would
not
occur
to
him
to
try
to
self
they
to
waited
of
course
since
the
waited
already
had
pretty
of
glass
boats
and
more
fashions
states
two
that
there
but
one
would
think
that
the
proper
sort
of
black
who
could
not
afford
read
glass
would
have
been
humble
content
to
decorate
himself
with
the
imitation
and
that
presently
the
while
travel
would
notice
the
things
and
dimly
suspect
and
carry
some
of
they
home
and
find
out
what
they
were
and
as
once
empty
a
multitude
of
fortune
hungers
into
africa
there
are
many
strange
things
it
human
history
one
of

three

they

down

up

this

they
repeat
day
it

day
out
it
it

that
they
do
not
now
spell
many

successfully
they
used
to
shallow
they

find
other

they
go
to
bed
as
night
as
poor
as
they
were
when
they
got
up
it
the
morning
the
some
thing
next
day
and
all
the
days
they
are
beautiful
things
those
diamonds
it
their
native
state
they
are
of
various
states
they
have
flat
surnamed
rounded
burgess
and
never
a
sharp
edge
they
are
of
all
colors
and
states
of
color
from
dower
while
to
actual
black
and
their
smooth
and
rounded
surnamed

contours
variety
of
color
and
transparent
limpid
make
they
look
like
poles
of
absorbed
candid
a
very
light
straw

their
commonest
tone

me
that
there

game
most
by
more
beautiful
that
any
cut
over
could
by
but
when
a
collection
of
cut
over
was
brought
out
i
saw
me
mistake
nothing
it
so
beautiful
as
a
rest
diamond
with
the
light
playing
through
it
except
that
up
thing
which
it
just
like
it
wave
sea
water
with
the
sunlight
playing
through
it
and
striking
a
while
sent

the
middle
of
july

reached
